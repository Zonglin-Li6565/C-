\section{Who I want to condition}
I want to condition my friend Neo to avoid watching a silly
vedio called Mr.Sun. He has been watching it for several monthes, and he watches
it everynight.

\section{Why I want to change that behavior}
Since that vedio is really silly and has no benifit for him, and watching it
again and again takes him a lot of time supposed to used on other more
productive things like studying and exercising, I decided to help him.
	
\section{Conditioning}

	\subsection{The process}
	Since Neo is generally watching the Mr.Sun at 8 to 10 p.m. everynight, I
	decided to employ my conditioning technique \textbf{after} 10 p.m, by giving him sugger
	if he doesn't watch Mr.Sun and study or exercses instead. I am going
	to train him for \textbf{four weeks}. In the first week, I will use
	\textbf{continuous} reinforcement since I want to get him quickly what he
	should do.
	Then, for the next three weeks, I will use the variable ratio schedule to train him. To be
	specific, for a period of various days with average of 3, the number of suggers
	he can get depends on how many days in that period he doesn't watch Mr.Sun and
	does the disired behavior. By using the variable ratio for the last 3 weeksï¼Œ I
	want to longer the extinction time of his disired behavior.
	
	\subsection{kind of reinforcer}
	I used positive reinforcer to train Neo. Since I will give him sugger, which is
	his favorite, after his response is dirsable, and that can increase the
	occurance of the desirable behavior. 
	
	\subsection{Another Method}
	I will use the positive punishment as an alternative way to train Neo.
	Everytime he watches Mr.Sun, I will punch him, which he doesn't like it.
